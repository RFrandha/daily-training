An array A consisting of N integers is given. A tricoloring of this array is a string consisting of N
characters such that each character is either 'R' (meaning red), 'G' (green) or 'B' (blue). The K-th
character of the string (where 0 s K < N) denotes the color of K-th element of the array. A
tricoloring is stable if the sum of red elements is equal to the sum of green elements and to the
sum of blue elements. A tricoloring does not necessarily use all three colors. The sum of
elements of a color that is not used is assumed to be 0.


For example, consider array A such that


A[0] = 3
A[3] = 5


A[1] = 7
A[4] =


A[2] = 2


The string "RRGG " is an example tricoloring of this array. It is not stable, because A[0] + A[1] = 10,
A[2] + A[3] = 7, A[4] = 4 and 10 *: 7 * 4. On the other hand, tricoloring "RGBBR" is stable, because
A[0] + A[4] = 7; A[1] = 7 and A[2]+ A[3] = 7.
Write a function


func Solution(A []int) string


that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns any stable tricoloring of this array. The
function should return the string "impossible" if no stable tricoloring exists.
For example, given array A such that
A[0] = 3
A[1] =7
A[2]= 2
A[3]
A[4]
a
5
= 4


the function may return "RGBBR", as explained above. Given array A such that
A[0]=3
A[1]= 6
A[2]
9


All changes saved


the function should return "impossible"
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptlons:


• N is an integer within the range [0..18)
• ach element of array A is an integer within the range [-100,000,000..100,000,000).
